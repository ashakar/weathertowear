# Weather Stylist

An interactive web application that advises users on how to dress based on the overall outdoor weather trends throughout the day.

## Motivation

Although we all have the weather apps on our laptops and smartphones, and with them, the plethora of information about the day's temperature
and weather patterns, essentially no one wants to take the time to examine the specific temperatures and weather patterns. Most of the time,
checking the weather means looking at the big number indicating the current outdoor temperature and perhaps the day's highs and lows. Unfortunately,
this often results in poor choices of clothing(for instance, wearing shorts and tank top on a day reported to be 72 degrees, but cloudy).
Wearing the wrong clothes for the temperature bears a much larger presence on all our routines than we'd like to admit since, simply put,
we're feeling uncomfortable and fantasizing about the better weather circumstances.

## Full Description
The Weather Stylist enables users to sign up for an account and essentially create their own "weather advisor". The tool is quite minimal in 
appearance - immediately upon logging in, users will be provided with a brief summary of the current/day's weather along with the weather
advisors clothing recommendations.Although initially, these recommendations will be based on default, pre-programmed values,
over time, the weather stylist can inteligently learn the user's own preferences and adjust its recommendations accordingly.
